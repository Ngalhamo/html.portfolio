<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I am Ngawang Lhamo. I am a basic cosing learner who joined this wonderful course couple a months back.
  I am from Karnataka and currently I am here in Madhya Pradesh studying in JEC College on the course Btech in 
  Computer Science and Engineering. It's been over two months since I came here and it feels home to be here and
  I enjoy studying here. I am trying my best to cope up with the stressful life of a college student by going out 
  sometimes and interacting with some of my friends. I am also trying to learn codings since this is what I must know
  even though the college is not really teaching it right now, this Udemy course was suggested to me by my senior to 
  whom I am thankful for, I will try my best to endeavor all the coding knowledge taught by the mentor.

<p>I heard the college life would be fun and tension free, I guess I heard it from the wrong person or the person
  who is not from my domain. It is true that we have a lot of freedom, freedom to roam whereever you want to without
  taking permission, eat whatever you want, freedom to bunk lectures(Only if you have 75% attendence....). But I guess
  these doesn't apply to me as true freedom because I had these freedoms before coming to college also, I guess my parents
  were not that strict. That's why I am not very overwhelmed to the extend that I start doing the things which will effects
  my studies, ALL THANKS TO MY FAMILY.

<p>At the end of the day it's up to you, the decision you take and the outlook you have towards your life. As for me 
  I really want to watch korean dramas but I have come to realize after deep thinking or quite few experiences that it
  really is waste of time and it's won's bring any improvement to my studies instead it will bring a lot of regrets.
  I do want to watch one episodes per day but I doubt my control if I could stop after one episode exactly or not.That's 
  why I have decided to read books instead of waatching dramas, but one day I will watch it when it is the right timing,
  right now I don't have the time to and also I have to focus more on myself, I don't want to escape the reality and 
  worry over the characters of the drama and their life story, first I have to worry about my life story.
  So that's all about my plan and my life uptill now!!!
